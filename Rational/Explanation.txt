Rational Numbers are relatively easy to represent simply as an ordered pair of integers, the numerator and denominator. However there are a few details that we need to deal with. In particular for the sake of readability we need the fraction to be in its canonical form. It would be strange to have 6/3 not simply be 2/1. To do this we simply divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor.
