# SimpleCAS

The purpose of SimpleCAS is not to provide a practical library for computer algebra since there are already much better options for that. Instead SimpleCAS is meant to be examinable for people who are curious about how such systems work.

## Features
Currently three kinds of objects are supported by SimpleCAS:

### Rational Numbers
Rational numbers are represented in simplest form.

### Univariate Polynomials
Univariate polynomials with rational coefficients.

### Rational Functions
True quotient of polynomials, represented in simplest form.

## Multivariate Polynomials
Multivariate polynomials would, to my knowledge, require fundamentally redesigning the logic of how the system treats polynomials to be vastly more complex. For this reason there are no plans to include multivariate polynomials in SimpleCAS.
