# SimpleCAS

The purpose of SimpleCAS is not to provide a practical library for computer algebra since there are already much better options for that. Instead SimpleCAS is meant to be examinable for people who are curious about how such systems work.

## Features
Currently three kinds of objects are supported by SimpleCAS:

### Rational Numbers
### Univariate Polynomials
### Rational Functions

## Planned Feature
Planned features include rational roots and full algebraic expressions. 

## Multivariate Polynomials
Multivariate polynomials would, to my knowledge, require fundamentally redesigning the logic of how the system treats polynomials to be vastly more complex. For this reason there are no plans to include multivariate polynomials in SimpleCAS.
